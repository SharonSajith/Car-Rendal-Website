                 <p>Thanks to sustained media attention and consumer expenditure, apps also produce major economic effects.
                     As an illustration, the TikTok app produces over one billion video views per day (Influencer Marketing Hub 2018;
                      Iqbal 2019) and, in addition to advertising income, garnered $50 million in consumer spending in the previous year
                       (Williams 2020). Another example of the crucial role apps play in helping businesses survive and rekindle client
                        experiences is the Zoom app, which produced $2.6 billion in income in 2020 (Sensor tower 2020). This worldwide
                         health and financial disaster was brought on by the COVID-19 epidemic.</p>
